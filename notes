Conflicts:
1. Can the attributes be put as nested element?
2. in IPC-2581 spec (pp. 20), PolyStepCurve default "counterclockwise",
   but in pp. 46 (top figure), default value of "clockwise" is "true".
3. top figure of page 176, Slot->Simple should have "substGrp == Simple",
   not "substGrp == UserPrimitive"

TODO:
1. Need to check occurence of all elements, attributes.
2. don't know some layers in ODB++. Ex: COMP_+_TOP, ROUT, SQA_AREAS, HEIGHT_TOP
