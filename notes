Conflicts:
1. Can the attributes be put as nested element?
2. in IPC-2581 spec (pp. 20), PolyStepCurve default "counterclockwise",
   but in pp. 46 (top figure), default value of "clockwise" is "true".
3. top figure of page 176, Slot->Simple should have "substGrp == Simple",
   not "substGrp == UserPrimitive"
4. IPC-2581 spec (pp. 45), the bottom graph is inconsistent with text.
   See the first PolyStepCurve.

TODO:
- Need to check occurence of all elements, attributes.
- don't know some layers in ODB++. Ex: COMP_+_TOP, ROUT, SQA_AREAS, HEIGHT_TOP
- maybe can write getReference() as template function in utils
- (bug) some extra symbols, some misplaced symbols
- need to implement command line arguments (input file, output file)
