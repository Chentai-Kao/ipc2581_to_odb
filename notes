Conflicts:
1. Can the attributes be put as nested element?
2. in IPC-2581 spec (pp. 20), PolyStepCurve default "counterclockwise",
   but in pp. 46 (top figure), default value of "clockwise" is "true".
3. top figure of page 176, Slot->Simple should have "substGrp == Simple",
   not "substGrp == UserPrimitive"
4. IPC-2581 spec (pp. 45), the bottom graph is inconsistent with text.
   See the first PolyStepCurve.

TODO:
1. Need to check occurence of all elements, attributes.
2. don't know some layers in ODB++. Ex: COMP_+_TOP, ROUT, SQA_AREAS, HEIGHT_TOP
3. adjust the unit (only inch in ODB++). maybe always store in inch
4. decompose symbol in ODB++ (e.g. hexagon donut...) marked as TODO
5. (rewrite) "non 90 degree increment" should be defined as user symbol
6. user symbol (under symbols/feature) (TODO: outline and polyline)
7. need to handle <LineDescRef> in Simple group (arc, line, outline, polyline)
